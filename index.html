          Hi! I’m DragonSenseiGuy, a developer who loves programming and creating practical applications. I enjoy working with Python, HTML, and CSS, and I contribute to multiple open-source projects. I was inspired to start programming because I wanted to build practical applications that hadn’t been made yet, simple solutions to everyday problems. I’m passionate about turning ideas into useful tools that make life a little easier.
